* Re-queue a segment to a file and re-queue the file to the NZB instance queue if a connection closes.
* Don't make any new connections when the NZB queue is empty.
* Add some callback for when the NZB queue is empty, so done. So the command line client can quit.
* Need to add a way to resume. Maybe marshal dump the NZB instances to their work directories
  ad reload those if they exist.
